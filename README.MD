# Delivery App:
This app was cloned from Deliveroo and Lineman application for example when users add food.

Instead of copied from the Deliveroo clone youtube video, I decided to write the code by myself especially the Redux Structure, styling components, etc.

# Stack
React Native + Tailwind + Sanity.io (CMS)

# Installation for Sanity
npm install @sanity/client @sanity/image-url

cd sanity

sanity cors add http://localhost:${PORT}
